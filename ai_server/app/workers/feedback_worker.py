"""
Feedback Worker Module.

Consumes PvP feedback requests from the pvp.feedback.request queue,
delegates the comparison analysis to PvpFeedbackService (Gemini API),
and publishes the result to the pvp.feedback.response queue.

The worker focuses solely on RabbitMQ communication;
all business logic is fully delegated to pvp_feedback_service.py.

[Error Handling Strategy]
On failure, this worker does NOT publish a FAIL response itself.
Instead, it re-raises the exception to let rabbitmq_service.py handle
the 3-retry logic and DLQ routing. The FAIL response is only published
by rabbitmq_service.py on the 3rd (final) failure attempt.

Note: pvp_feedback_service.py has its own internal tenacity-based
retry (3 attempts with exponential backoff) for Gemini API failures.
This operates independently of the queue-level retry mechanism.
