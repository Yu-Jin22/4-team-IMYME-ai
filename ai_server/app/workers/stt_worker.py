"""
STT Worker Module.

Consumes audio file URLs from the pvp.stt.request queue,
calls the RunPod STT server for speech-to-text conversion,
and publishes the result to the pvp.stt.response queue.

[Error Handling Strategy]
On failure, this worker does NOT publish a FAIL response itself.
Instead, it re-raises the exception to let rabbitmq_service.py handle
the 3-retry logic and DLQ routing. The FAIL response is only published
by rabbitmq_service.py on the 3rd (final) failure attempt.
